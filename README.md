# Hi, I'm Nyri 👋

## About Me
I'm Nyri, a 14-year-old developer from America with a passion for game hacking and reverse engineering. I love diving deep into code, breaking things apart to see how they tick, and building tools that push the limits in games. My main focus is **C++**, but I’m also familiar with **C#**, **Python**, **Flask**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

### What I Do 🛠️
- **Game Hacking**: I create external/internal tools, cheats, and game mods.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Taking apart software to make new opportunities or uncover hidden features.
- **Web Development**: Small but powerful apps built with Flask and web technologies.
- **Open Source**: Contributor to various projects focusing on privacy and free, accessible tools.

### Languages & Tools 💻
- **C++**: My primary language for game hacking and low-level programming.
- **Python**: Perfect for quick scripts, automation, and prototyping.
- **Flask**: Lightweight and powerful for web applications.
- **C#**: Still learning, but handy for making utilities.
- **HTML/CSS**: To make things look good on the web.
