# hi, i'm nyri 👋

## about me
i'm nyri, a 14-year-old developer from america who loves game hacking and reverse engineering! ^-^ i enjoy digging deep into code, breaking stuff apart to see how it all works, and building tools to push the limits in games. my main focus is **c++**, but i also mess around with **c#**, **python**, **flask**, **html**, and **css**.

### what i do 🛠️
- **game hacking**: i make external/internal tools, cheats, and mods for games.
- **reverse engineering**: i take apart software to unlock new possibilities or uncover hidden features.
- **web development**: i build small, but powerful apps using flask and web tech.
- **open source**: i contribute to projects that focus on privacy and creating free, accessible tools.

### languages & tools 💻
- **c++**: my go-to language for game hacking and low-level stuff.
- **python**: great for quick scripts, automation, and prototyping.
- **flask**: lightweight and awesome for web apps.
- **c#**: still learning, but it’s handy for making utilities.
- **html/css**: for making things look cool on the web!
